==================

This program make a photo mosaic by some function, the way that she do that is 
to filter a list of many tiles in order to create a smaller list of best tiles,
(that their average color is very close to the average color of the objective).
The program uses 'get best tiles' function to do this.
After that the program uses 'choose tile' function that choose the best tile,
that will fit the picture, ba compare pixels.
The function 'get piece' helps the program to divide the real image to
tiles, and 'set piece' function changes each tile of the real image, and by 
'choose tile' function choose the best tile to replace him.
